            <p>Driven by a creative mindset and a knack for learning new things I have decided to delve into the tech
                space and leave a mark. You can find out more about me below!</p> </div>

            <h4>Career so far!</h4>
                <p>I basically started out wanting to be a teacher, which lead me to learning all I could. Then I
                    discovered I also loved learning and writng about what I have learnt. </p>
                <p>With years of writing professionally, I decided the next thing I want to learn and possibly teach
                    soon is software
                    development.
                </p>And so the journey started with HTML and CSS, and I have not had a dull moment ever
                since! </p>
